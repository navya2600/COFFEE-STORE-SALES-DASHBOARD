# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

This repository contains the Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard project files. The dashboard was created using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, processed and visualized in Microsoft Excel.

## Dataset
The original dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle's public datasets. It includes various details about coffee shop sales, including transactions, product categories, and sales performance across different locations.

## Data Preparation
The data was imported into Excel, where it was cleansed and structured using Power Query. During the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.
- Normalized the data for consistency.
- Engineered features to aid in more insightful analysis.

## Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
Post data cleaning, we utilized Pivot Tables to summarize the data effectively. This allowed me to analyze the dataset from multiple dimensions and calculate metrics like total sales, average order value, and product category distribution.

## Dashboard Creation
The dashboard was designed to provide a clear and interactive overview of sales performance. Key components include:
- Total sales and footfall metrics.
- Average order value over time.
- Quantity of products ordered hourly.
- Sales distribution over various store locations.
- Product category sales distribution pie chart.
- Sales performance of the top 5 products.
- Slicers for dynamic filtering by month and day of the week.

## Interactive Features
Slicers and timelines were incorporated to enable interactive filtering, allowing users to drill down into specific months or days to analyze trends and performance metrics.

## Exporting Data
All tables and charts were configured to allow easy exporting of data for reporting or further analysis.

## How to Use
To view the dashboard, simply open the `COFFEE SHOP SALES DASHBOARD.xlsx` file in Excel. You can interact with the data using the provided slicers and pivot chart controls.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel for Mac or Windows with support for Power Query and Pivot Tables.
- Basic knowledge of navigating Excel Pivot Tables and slicers.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Kaggle community for providing the dataset which made this analysis possible.
